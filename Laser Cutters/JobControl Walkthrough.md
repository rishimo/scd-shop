# JobControl Walkthrough

**Before getting on one of the lasers,** first, use one of our laser templates to prepare your file following the instructions and styleguide included in the template. If you need help, don't be afraid to come in during our open hours and check your file with shop staff!

Once your file is ready, get in line for the lasers and put your file on a flash drive. When your turn comes, go to an open laser and open up your file. This walkthrough will only include instructions for AutoCAD and Illustrator, but files can be sent from other software such as Inkscape, using the same styleguide and a similar printing process. 

## Sending from AutoCAD
1. Type into the commandline `plot`, or go to File -> Plot. This is essentially AutoCAD's printing function. The following window should open.
