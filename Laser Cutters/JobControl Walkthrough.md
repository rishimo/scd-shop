# JobControl Walkthrough

**Before getting in line for the lasers:** use one of our laser templates to prepare your file following the instructions and styleguide included in the template. If you need help, don't be afraid to come in during our open hours and check your file with shop staff!

Once your file is ready, get in line for the lasers and put your file on a flash drive. When your turn comes, go to an open laser and open up your file. This walkthrough will only include instructions for AutoCAD and Illustrator, but files can be sent from other software such as Inkscape, using the same styleguide and a similar printing process. 

## Sending from AutoCAD
To start, either into the commandline `plot`, or go to File -> Plot. This will open what is essentially AutoCAD's printing function. The following window should open.

This may look like a lot, but we only need to worry about 3 main things, shown in the image below.

![starter_highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theLadyStardust/scd-shop/main/images/starter_highlighted.png)

1. Plotter: This is the printer output. Select "Trotec Engraver vXX.X.X" from the plotter dropdown.

2. Plot Area: This is what will be plotted. First, select "Window" from the "What to Plot" dropdown

Then select the area you want to laser. 

![windowareaselect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theLadyStardust/scd-shop/main/images/autocadwindowselect.JPG)

If you want to reselect this area, you can hit the "Window<" button this is now next to the "What to Plot"

3. Plot Scale: This is the scale at which this will be plotted. All of The Shop's templates are 1 plot unit = 1 inch, so generally you'll select 1:1, and inches here. To do this, first deselect the "fit to paper" box, then change the "Scale" dropdown to 1:1 with the units in inches.

Once you have this, you can select "Apply to Layout" in order to save these settings to your file. When you go to plot next time, it will have these same settings. Then, hit "Ok" to send to JobControl.

## Sending from Illustrator
To start, print by using Control + P or going to File -> Print. It should open up the following window.

Select "Trotec Engraver vXX.X.X" from the printer dropdown.

Under Options, find the Scaling dropdown and select "Do Not Scale." This will ensure that hairline strokes for cut and engrave lines will stay as such in the printing process.

From here, you can just print to send it to JobControl.

### Dithering and Images

If you're wanting to print images from Illustrator to have a grayscale effect with the laser, you may want to check out the various dithering algorithms included with JobControl. To do this, from the print dialogue, hit `Setup...`, then `Preferences` after selecting the printer. Then, in the `Halftone` dropdown under `Process Options`,
