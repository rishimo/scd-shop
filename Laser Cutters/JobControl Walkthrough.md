# JobControl Walkthrough

**Before getting on one of the lasers,** first, use one of our laser templates to prepare your file following the instructions and styleguide included in the template. If you need help, don't be afraid to come in during our open hours and check your file with shop staff!

Once your file is ready, get in line for the lasers and put your file on a flash drive. When your turn comes, go to an open laser and open up your file. This walkthrough will only include instructions for AutoCAD and Illustrator, but files can be sent from other software such as Inkscape, using the same styleguide and a similar printing process. 

## Sending from AutoCAD
1. Type into the commandline `plot`, or go to File -> Plot. This is essentially AutoCAD's printing function. The following window should open.

This may look like a lot, but we only need to worry about 3 main things, shown in the image below.

1. Plotter: This is the printer output. Select "Trotec Engraver vXX.X.X" from the plotter dropdown. 

2. Plot Area: This is what will be plotted. First, select "Window" from the "What to Plot" dropdown

Then select the area you want to laser.

If you want to reselect this area, you can hit the "Window<" button this is now next to the "What to Plot"

3. Plot Scale: This is the scale at which this will be plotted. All of The Shop's templates are 1 plot unit = 1 inch, so generally you'll select 1:1, and inches here. To do this, first deselect the "fit to paper" box, then change the "Scale" dropdown to 1:1 with the units in inches.

Once you have this, you can select "Apply to Layout" in order to save these settings to your file. When you go to plot next time, it will have these same settings. Then, hit "ok" to send to JobControl.
